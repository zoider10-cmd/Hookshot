/* (hookshot) Native mouse look (the Insert menu's "Mouse camera", off by default; HOS_MOUSE_NATIVE=1 or 0 overrides it):
   the captured mouse turns the player camera's own yaw and pitch, in degrees, with no dead zone, no response curve, no
   smoothing and no top speed, in place of the mouse as the right stick (nn_hid.c's mouse_stick).

   Where the angles are: the player camera's update, f_80644c80 (a virtual method, the camera in x0), calls
   hos_mouse_camera first (nx2/oot_patches.py, patch_mouse_camera), on the game's thread, once a frame while that camera
   runs. The camera holds its pitch limits at +0x178 ({-85, 89} in the field), its pitch at +0x18c and its yaw at +0x1a4.
   The game turns them by the right stick in f_80649c10 (yaw, wrapped at 180) and f_8064b770 (pitch, within the limits),
   which f_80644c80 calls only while the stick is out of its dead zone (found with hardware write watchpoints on the two
   angles in Kokiri Forest). Yaw falls as the view turns right and pitch rises as it tilts down.

   The camera's state at +0x204 is 3 while it follows Link by itself, and then it eases the pitch back to its rest over a
   couple of seconds; the right stick makes it 4 (the player's), where a pitch stays where it was put. The mouse leaves the
   state as it is: written there from here the game puts it back and the angles with it the next frame. So a pitch the
   mouse chose eases back as one the game chose does, while yaw stays.

   The motion is added before the camera reads its input, so the game's own collision, lock-on and scripted cameras still
   follow. While the hook has run in the last 150 ms the mouse's motion is the camera's (hos_mouse_native gives 1: the
   right stick is left alone); otherwise (the pause menu, cutscenes with another camera, a build the patch did not find
   its place in) it is the right stick as before.

   The sensitivity is the mouse's (the menu's Mouse sensitivity, - and =): 0.1 degrees a count at 1. HOS_MOUSE_INVERT_Y=1
   or the menu's Invert mouse vertical flips up and down. */
