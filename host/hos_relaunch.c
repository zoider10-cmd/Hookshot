/* (hookshot) The Insert menu's Restart now (gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp): it saves its options and asks the window to close for a
   restart (WM_APP + 9: host/display.c, host/posix/display_sdl.c). The window closes as when the player closes it, and at
   the very end of that, instead of only exiting, the game is started again:
     Linux: the process becomes the game again (execve) with the arguments and the environment it started with
     (/proc/self/cmdline and /proc/self/environ: hookshot_env.txt's lines are read again, not kept), so whatever waits
     for it (the launcher, a stream, a test) still has it. The game is bin/hookshot on disk, never run from inside the
     AppImage (hookshot-launch starts it with the AppImage's variables taken away), so /proc/self/exe is the game;
     argv[0] on the PATH if that is gone (the folder built again meanwhile).
     Windows: a new process of this executable (GetModuleFileNameW) with this one's command line (GetCommandLineW), in
     the same folder and environment; then this one exits. */
