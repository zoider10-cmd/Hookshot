/* nn::hid: one Pro Controller (FullKey style) on Npad No.1, from every XInput gamepad and the keyboard and mouse at
   once. Buttons map by position (the Xbox bottom face button is the Switch's bottom one, B).

   (hookshot) What presses each button, on a gamepad and on the keyboard, is the player's: the Insert menu's Controls
   page (gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp) changes it, kept in hookshot_options.ini (binds_load). The defaults:
   Keyboard (totk-pc-recomp's layout): WASD left stick, arrows or IJKL right stick (camera), Space X (jump), E A
   (action), Shift B (run/cancel), Q L (abilities), R R, Z ZL, X or F ZR (bow), Ctrl left-stick click (crouch), C
   right-stick click (first person), Tab or Enter Plus, M Minus (map), 1 2 3 4 d-pad left, up, right, down. Only
   while the game's window is in front (the key state is global).
   Mouse (after a click in the window, display.c; Esc releases): its motion is the right stick (mouse panning,
   mouse_stick), or with the Insert menu's "Mouse camera" set to Native (HOS_MOUSE_NATIVE=1 or 0 overrides it) turns
   the camera itself (mouse_native.c); left button Y (attack), right button ZL (shield, lock on). - and = change its sensitivity (x0.8 /
   x1.25, shown in the title bar, kept by the Insert menu's Mouse sensitivity row); HOS_MOUSE_SENS=<x> sets it,
   HOS_MOUSE_INVERT_Y=1 (or the menu's Invert mouse vertical) flips up/down.

   Controllers count only while the game's window is in front, like the keyboard, unless the Insert menu's "Controller in
   background" is on (or HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=1; =0 keeps them to the window in front whatever the menu says): then a
   game streamed from a screen of its own, or left running behind another window, still follows the pad. The keyboard
   and mouse stay with the window in front either way.

   HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT (test runs): timed presses added to the input, "<seconds>:<button>[+<button>...][/<ms held>],..."
   with buttons A B X Y L R ZL ZR PLUS MINUS LS RS LEFT UP RIGHT DOWN and the stick directions LUP LDOWN LLEFT
   LRIGHT RUP RDOWN RLEFT RRIGHT; held 200 ms unless given. Example: "50:A,52:A,80:LUP/4000".

   Npad states share one layout (NpadCommonState): { s64 sampling; u64 buttons; s32 lx, ly; s32 rx, ry; u32 attributes;
   pad } = 0x28 bytes. */

/* The mouse as the right stick, "mouse panning" as MacNativeGames does it (games/totk/runtime/mouse_look.h,
   github.com/ly05010419/MacNativeGames, MIT; the idea is yuzu's): every movement adds to a held deflection, and a
   tick every 10 ms shows it to the game and then lets it decay. The camera keeps turning while the mouse moves and
   settles smoothly when it stops, whatever the mouse's report rate, the game's frame rate or how often it reads the
   pad (the old speed-per-8-ms stick jumped between reads). The decay grows with the deflection (1 - length^2 *
   decay), at least min_decay a tick; the held length is cut to 1.5 (past the stick's edge, so a steady turn is easy
   to hold) and shown at most 1. A movement that leaves less than 20% is lifted to 20%, past the game's dead zone.
   MacNativeGames' decay (18%, at least 6%) suits a trackpad: with a mouse the camera drifted on for 0.4 s after it
   stopped. Here 30%, at least 20% (HOS_MOUSE_DECAY / HOS_MOUSE_MIN_DECAY, percent): it stops within ~0.1 s, and one
   raw count moves the stick by sensitivity * 0.03, so at 1 the deflection follows 100-700 counts/s (0.2 to ~0.9)
