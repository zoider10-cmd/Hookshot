/* Game controllers through SDL (host/hos_sdl.c: SDL3, else SDL2, third_party/sdl2/SDL2.dll; zlib license, loaded at
   run time): DualSense, DualShock 4, Switch Pro, Xbox and most other pads, over USB or Bluetooth. XInput alone sees
   only Xbox-style pads.

   A thread of its own (on Linux the window's, which runs SDL there too) opens every controller SDL knows (and ones
   plugged in later), polls them every 4 ms and keeps
   the merged state; nn_hid.c ORs it into the input with XInput, keyboard and mouse. Without SDL nothing
   changes. HOS_NO_SDL=1 leaves SDL out. The inputs go by position (HOS_PAD_*, SDL's own order: the bottom face button
   first, cross on a DualSense, A on an Xbox pad); nn_hid.c's controls make them the Switch's buttons.

   (hookshot) Motion: with the Insert menu's Motion controls on (the default), the open pad with a gyroscope and an
   accelerometer (Switch Pro and pads in Switch mode, DualSense, DualShock 4, others) that was used last has them read
   each poll and turned into the six-axis state OoT aims with (host/hos_motion.h), which nn_hid.c's
   GetSixAxisSensorStates gives the game; Motion sensitivity X/Y and Invert motion X/Y apply there. Off, or with no such pad, the game sees the pad
   lying still, as before. */
