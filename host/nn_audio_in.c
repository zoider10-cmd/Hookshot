/* (hookshot) nn::audio's input streams: the microphone, as the ocarina's "play with your voice / an instrument" option uses it.

   The game lists the virtual input devices once at its start (ListVirtualInputDevices) and opens two input streams only if
   there is one: one on the default virtual device, one on the "true raw" one (GetTrueRawAudioInputDevice), both 48 kHz,
   mono, 16-bit (its StreamFormat: {PcmInt16, 1 channel, 48000}). With the ocarina's microphone mode on it starts them
   (StartInputStream when GetInputStreamState is not 2), reads up to 256 frames a frame (GetInputStreamFilledFrameCount,
   ReadInputStream) and works the notes out itself. Without these the stubs listed no device: the game never opened a
   stream, and the ocarina never heard anything.

   Here there is always one device of each kind (as on the console, whose microphone is always there). The started streams
   of one format share a source: one microphone opened once, through SDL3, or SDL2 as the Linux AppImage carries
   (host/hos_sdl.c), converted to that format; what it records goes to each stream's own buffer, the newest capacity's
   worth kept. Which one is the Insert menu's choice (gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp, Gameplay: Microphone), told by hos_mic_select:
   off, the system's default, or a microphone by its name. One that is not there, does not open, stops sending, or is no
   longer listed (pulled out: looked for every 5 s, as one pulled out can go on sending zeros): the default stands in for
   it (silence when there is none either) and it is tried again, found by its name in a list made then (it may come back
   under another id), after 3 s, then twice as long each time up to a minute; once it gives sound again the waits start
   over. Off, or no SDL: silence at the stream's rate, so the game's reads go on as they
   would. A change in the menu takes effect at the next read. HOS_MIC_LOG=1: a line a second while a stream runs (its
   frames and level). */
