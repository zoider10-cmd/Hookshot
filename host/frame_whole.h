/* (hookshot) Whole frames out of a frame step that can be under one, for the game's counters that add the step, or the step
   times a whole number, cut to whole frames (nx2/oot_patches.py patch_whole_frames). At the console's 60 fps the step is 1 and
   they count frames. Under a Frame rate cap above 60 the step is the frame's own time (host/nn_vi.c, hos_frame_seconds_bits):
   0.42 at 144 fps, cut to 0 every frame, and the counter never moves, so what waits on it never comes: the pick-up indicator
   above Link's head counts the rupees shown up to the wallet's (f_80a87e50: the shown +864 moves by (int)(step * the
   distance / 50, at least 1)) and fades only when they meet; it stayed at the old count until a door or a talk replaced it.
   While the frames' own time is the step (carry), the amount is added to the counter's own remainder and the whole frames in
   it are handed out, so the counter moves at the game's rate whatever the frame rate. Otherwise it is cut as the game cuts it:
   60 fps as before. One remainder per counter address, a few slots (the counters are few), reused oldest first. Not
   thread-safe by itself: the caller holds a lock. */
