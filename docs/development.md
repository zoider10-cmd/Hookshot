# Hookshot (oot-recomp)

**Hookshot** is the port's name (as Skybound is TOTKPort's and BlueShell is mkw-recomp's); the maintainer's repository
folder stays `oot-recomp`. The game builds as `hookshot.exe` + `hookshot_vk.dll` (`hookshot` + `hookshot_vk.so` on Linux).

A static recompilation of the Switch 2 *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* remake to native x86-64 Windows and Linux:
the game's code lifted to C (NotRexed's a64-kit, Rexcomp's AArch64 kit), the Horizon OS and NVN2 implemented
natively, the GPU work replayed on Vulkan. It is a fork of mkw-recomp (`..\mkw-recomp`, Mario Kart World), whose
paths it keeps so MKW's fixes apply here.

**No game files are in this repository.** The dump is read where it lies (`work/dump.txt`); everything made from it
(modules, image, lifted C, builds, runs) goes to `work/`, which git ignores.

Status: the game plays; the README's [status table](../readme.md#project-status) says how far. The design, its stages and
the lessons carried over from MKW: [design.md](design.md).

## Use

Requirements: Python 3 with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (`lz4`, `numpy`, `capstone`, `unicorn` 2.1,
`zstandard`, and the button-prompt packages); a compiler: on Windows llvm-mingw
(`HOOKSHOT_MINGW`, or an `llvm-mingw` folder in the clone), else emsdk's clang at `C:\emsdk` (or `EMSDK`) with Visual
Studio's C++ tools; on Linux clang and lld. For the Vulkan back end: distro Vulkan / SPIR-V / VMA headers under
`/usr`, or `HOOKSHOT_VULKAN_HEADERS` / `HOOKSHOT_SPIRV_HEADERS` / `HOOKSHOT_VMA_HEADERS`, or a CPM package cache
(`RX_CPM`, else `cpm` in the clone, else the old caches in mkw-recomp's `work/eg` or `..\Eglantine\.cache\cpm`).
Without those the standalone build stops. [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup) has the rest.

Run everything with `python -I` from this folder.

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `python -I nx2/nup.py <file.nup> --extract work/dump` | the `.nup` dump package to `work/dump/exefs` + `romfs` (newest title; ZBIC NSOs made plain by `nx2/unpack.py`) |
| `python -I nx2/dump.py --dump <folder with exefs/ and romfs/> --set` | what the dump is (Switch 1 or 2, ids, modules, SDK, NVN); `--set` records it in `work/dump.txt` |
| `python -I nx2/lift.py [--write]` | image + discovery + coverage (`work/image/coverage.txt`); `--write` emits the C to `work/gen` |
| `python -I nx2/census.py --nx2` | instruction census per module, after the Switch 2 forms |
| `python -I nx2/test_insn.py [--per 6 --states 12]` | every instruction form the game uses, Unicorn vs lifted C |
| `python -I nx2/test_leaf.py [--count 3000 --states 4] [--calls]` | random whole functions (or call trees), Unicorn vs recompiled native code on the real image |
| `python -I nx2/lift.py --standalone --write` then `python -I nx2/build.py --standalone --jobs 4` | the standalone game: `work/sa/build/hookshot.exe` + `hookshot_vk.dll` |
| `powershell -File scripts/run-vk.ps1 [-Window] [-Seconds 120] [-Name x]` | a muted test run on Vulkan, with screenshots in `work/runs/<name>/shots` |
| `python -I scripts/prof.py <stacks file>` | a profile sampled with `HOS_PROFILE=<seconds>` + `HOS_SAMPLE=<thread>` + `HOS_SAMPLE_FILE=<stacks file>` (the sampler runs only with `HOS_PROFILE` set), named from the linker maps |

The dump can also come from `OOT_DUMP` (its folder) or `OOT_EXEFS`; `OOT_WORK` moves the work folder.

The built game's own arguments (`image.bin`, `--romfs`, `--user`, `--trace`, `--prepare-shaders`) are in the README's
[Running the game from the command line](../readme.md#running-the-game-from-the-command-line).

Scripted test input (`HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT` and `HOS_INPUT_LIVE`) is applied before the window-focus check. A log saying
the game window is not in front does not mean those presses were discarded. `HOS_HEADLESS` and
`HOS_WINDOW_NOACTIVATE` change window creation, not this input routing. The game must still reach a state that reads
and responds to the supplied controller input.

Physical keyboard and mouse input stays with the foreground window. Physical controllers can also play in the
background when the existing "Controller in background" option or `HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=1` enables them;
`HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND=0` overrides that option. With `HOS_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE` set (to any value, `0` too) the script
alone drives the game until 5 s after its last press; without it the player's devices add to the script's presses. It
is not a focus override.

## Switches for testing and debugging

The running game reads its switches from the environment or from `hookshot_env.txt` beside `image.bin` (one
`NAME=VALUE` a line, `#` for notes; `HOS_ENV_FILE=<path>` reads that file instead). The build reads its own from the
environment. The README has the ones players are asked to try (`RX_VK_ASTC_RGBA8`, `RX_VK_LOW_SPEC`,
`RX_VK_MOVIE_UPSCALE`, `RX_VK_SKIP_CODE`, `HOS_OOT_CHEATS`). There are several hundred more, most of them one-off
experiments: `grep -rn 'getenv("' host gpu/vk` lists them, and the comment where each is read says what it does.
"Set" below means any value, `0` included.

`RX_VK_MESH_NOCULL=<prefix,...>` turns off the culling in the task shaders whose native code key starts with one of
the prefixes. On a Steam Deck, `RX_VK_MESH_NOCULL=2c56dc1006942f74` avoids the same hang without leaving anything out:
that task shader walks a coarse depth grid cell by cell for every meshlet and ends with
`visible = (result & 1) | (c3[2320] & 4)`, bit 4 being the game's own "draw everything". The switch makes that answer
true, and dead code elimination removes the grid walk, so every meshlet is drawn and the rasterizer clips what is off
screen. It costs some GPU time on cards that cull quickly, so it is off unless set. The log says
"culling off, every meshlet drawn" for each task shader it changed.

### Running a test

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOS_HEADLESS` (set) | No window: the renderer draws offscreen, for screenshots and frame dumps |
| `HOS_WINDOW_SIZE=<w>x<h>` | The window's size in pixels (1280x720 by default, wider for an ultrawide picture) |
| `HOS_WINDOW_NOACTIVATE` (set) | The window opens behind the others and does not take the focus (Windows) |
| `HOS_FULLSCREEN=1` | Starts in fullscreen; the Insert menu's Fullscreen row is then left alone |
| `HOS_AUDIO=0` | No sound device is opened (the mixer still runs); `scripts/run-vk.ps1` sets it unless `-Sound` |
| `HOS_LANGUAGE=<code>` | The game's language for this run, a code from `language.txt` |
| `HOS_OUTPUT_RES=<width>x<height>`, `HOS_HANDHELD=1`, `HOS_ASPECT=<ratio>` | Over the options file: the output resolution (a size, as `output_res`), the handheld profile, a picture wider than 16:9 (2.3889 for 3440x1440) |
| `HOS_DYNRES=0`, `HOS_REALTIME_STEP=0`, `HOS_TEXT_SPEED=<0..3>` | Over the options file: Resolution 100% (non-zero: Auto), Game speed Per frame (1: Real time), Text speed |
| `RX_VK_FRAMEGEN=0`, `RX_VK_FRAMEGEN_MULT=<2..8>`, `RX_VK_PACE=0`, `RX_VK_UPSCALE=<0..2>` | No frame generation whatever the menu says; over the options file: its multiplier, frame pacing, the upscaling filter |
| `RX_VK_DEVICE=<n>` | The graphics card listed as `vk: device <n>` in the log, over the menu's GPU device |
| `HOOKSHOT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` | No look for a newer release at the start |
| `HOS_TRACE=1` | Every Horizon call logged, as `--trace` does |
| `RX_BACKEND=<name>` | Unset or `vulkan`: `hookshot_vk.dll`; any other value but `eden`: the WebGPU renderer, when the exe was built with one |

### Input for scripted runs

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT=<presses>` | Presses timed from the game's first controller read |
| `HOS_INPUT_LIVE=<file>` | A file the test appends lines of presses to, read every 30 ms; each line's times count from when it is read. A line `!cheat <n>` sends a Cheats page action, `!synclog` logs the NVN syncs (`!dump`, `!shots`, `!rdoc` and `!flasharm` are the WebGPU renderer's) |
| `HOS_INPUT_FRAME_CLOCK=1` | The script's time runs at 60 game frames a second instead of the wall clock |
| `HOS_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE`, `HOS_INPUT_BACKGROUND`, `HOS_INPUT_SCRIPT_BACKGROUND` (set) | As above; the last lets every device count while the window is behind another one |
| `RX_VK_MENU_SCRIPT=<seconds>:<key>,...` | Timed Insert menu keys: `INS`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `ESC`, `ENTER`, `TABL`, `TABR` |
| `RX_VK_UI_PROMPTS=pad` or `keys` | The menu's button prompts for a controller or the keys, whatever was used last (screenshots) |
| `RX_VK_UI_GAME_FONT=0` | The menu, the counter and the start-up screen in the included Libertinus, not the game's own font |

The presses are `<seconds>:<button>[+<button>...][/<ms>]`, separated by commas, for example `2:A,5.5:LUP/1500,9:ZL+R`.
The buttons are `A B X Y L R ZL ZR PLUS MINUS LS RS LEFT UP RIGHT DOWN`, and the sticks pushed to their edge `LUP
LDOWN LLEFT LRIGHT RUP RDOWN RLEFT RRIGHT`. A press is held for 200 ms unless `/<ms>` says otherwise. The names are
case-sensitive, and an unknown one is ignored.

### Pictures and frames

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RX_VK_SHOTS=<dir>` | A PNG every `RX_VK_SHOT_EVERY` presents (300) as `vk_<present>.png`, at `RX_VK_SHOT_W` x `RX_VK_SHOT_H` (1280x720) |
| `RX_VK_FLASH=1` | The flash detector, with `RX_VK_SHOTS` and `RX_VK_SHOT_EVERY=1`: writes the frames around a flash and dumps the next one |
| `RX_VK_FRAMELOG=<file>` | Every frame shown, at 320x180, while `<file>.go` exists; `python -I scripts/framelog.py <file>` finds the flashes |
| `RX_VK_DUMP=<present>[+<count>][,...]` | Every step of the frame after that present as PNGs, in `dump_<present>` under `RX_VK_DUMP_DIR` (or `RX_VK_SHOTS`, or the current folder); `RX_VK_DUMP_STEPS=<lo>-<hi>` and `RX_VK_DUMP_PROGS=<key>,...` narrow it |
| `RX_VK_PASS_TRACE=1` | The passes of the last frames, logged at a flash or a dark frame (`RX_VK_PASS_TRACE_AT=<n>`: every n-th present) |
| `RX_VK_PROBE=1` or `2` | The centre texel after every pass: `probe_<frame>.txt` at a flash (1), or `probe_all_<n>.txt` at speed (2); `python -I scripts/probe.py` reads them |
| `RX_VK_DUMP_FAILED=<dir>` | The native code of every program that does not translate, for `nx2/lower_test.py` (game data: keep it local) |

### Time and profiles

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOS_PROFILE=<seconds>` | Every interval, the busiest threads in the log; it also starts the samplers below |
| `HOS_SAMPLE=<thread>` + `HOS_SAMPLE_FILE=<file>` | One thread's stacks, sampled every millisecond (needs `HOS_PROFILE`); `python -I scripts/prof.py <file>` reads them |
| `HOS_SAMPLE_ALL=<file>` | Every game and renderer thread every 2 ms while `<file>.go` exists (needs `HOS_PROFILE`); `scripts/crit.py`, `scripts/vkprof.py` and `scripts/hotlist.py` read it (on Linux with `RX_MAPS=<game folder>`: they name frames from its `hookshot` and `hookshot_vk.so`) |
| `HOS_THREAD_TIMES=<seconds>` | Every interval, the threads that used over 5% of a core |
| `HOS_FPS_LOG` (set), `HOS_PRESENT_TRACE=<csv>` | The game's frame limiter, VRR flags and nominal rate every 300 presents, and the game clock's speed (1.000: real time); a CSV line per game present with host-clock times before queue flushing, around the renderer call, after virtual-core reacquisition, and at the return counter. These are CPU wall times, not GPU completion or scanout; async rendering measures the enqueue call. Unset/empty trace adds no clock reads |
| `HOS_FPS_MAX=<61-1000>` | A frame rate cap for one run, over the Game frame rate cap row (1000 is Uncapped's) |
| `RX_VK_FRAME_LOG=<csv>` | A CSV line per present: frame, seconds, frame time in ms |
| `RX_VK_PASS_TIMING=1` or `2` | GPU time per pass (2: per program too), logged every 600 presents |
| `RX_VK_SLOW_LOG=<ms>` | The replay's times for each frame that took longer than this |
| `HOS_PGO=<file>` | In a run of an `RX_PGO=gen` build: `<file>.reset` clears the counters, `<file>.dump` writes them to `<file>`. It is read before `hookshot_env.txt`, so set it in the environment |

### The GPU

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `RX_VK_VALIDATION` (set) | The Khronos validation layer |
| `RX_VK_CHECKPOINTS=0` | No NVIDIA checkpoints (on by default; after a lost device they name the draw it stopped at) |
| `RX_VK_HANG_DUMP=<file>` | Every thread's stack to the file once no frame was shown for `RX_VK_HANG_SEC` seconds (20) (Windows) |
| `RX_VK_NOOPT` (set) | Pipelines built without the driver's optimisations |
| `RX_VK_SKIP_PROG=<prefix>,...` | Leaves out the draws of these programs (default `53509044401d78d2`; `-` leaves out none) |
| `RX_VK_PIPE_SKIP=0` | A draw whose pipeline is not ready waits for it, instead of being left out when its targets hold an earlier frame |
| `RX_VK_PRECOMPILE=0` or `1` | The shader preparation before the title off or on (on in builds made with `RX_RELEASE=1`, as the builders' are) |
| `RX_VK_TASK_MESH_FALLBACK=0` or `1` | Task + mesh draws through the compute fallback (1) or the driver's mesh shaders (0). By default the fallback is on for AMD's Navi 21 and Navi 22 on Windows (RX 6800, 6800 XT, 6900 XT, 6700 XT), where the native path timed out the driver (issue 996) |
| `RX_VK_NO_PROGRAM_CACHE` (set) | Neither reads nor writes `hookshot_programs.bin` and the pipeline notes |
| `RX_VK_UB_WORD_HASH=0` | A/B test: use the old low-address-bit index for cached uniform words (default: mix upper address bits to reduce aligned-buffer collisions) |
| `RX_VK_MIRROR=0`, `RX_VK_MIRROR_MB=<MB>` | No VRAM mirrors of the game's memory pools (on for discrete cards); their budget |
| `RX_VK_VRAM_MB=<MB>` | The texture cache's budget (default 70% of what the driver allows, at most 6 GB) |
| `RX_VK_COMPACT=1`, `RX_VK_COMPACT_PCT=<50..90>`, `RX_VK_COMPACT_MB=<MB>` | VRAM compaction (off by default): the textures that are not render targets in a pool of their own, moved out of sparsely used blocks a few a present so that the blocks go back to the driver, and the texture budget holding the driver's count at that share of what it allows (85); the free space that starts a run (512; 192 while the count is over 90%) |
| `RX_VK_NO_WRITEBACK` (set) | GPU writes to mirrored pools are not copied back to guest memory (an experiment, for A/B) |
| `RX_VK_WB_DIFF=0` | Write-backs copy every byte again instead of only what changed against a VRAM shadow (the diff is on by default; v2.0.9 and v2.0.10 had it off, issue 1161) |
| `RX_VK_DLSS=0/1/2`, `RX_VK_DLSS_PRESET=<letter>`, `RX_VK_DLSS_LOG=1`, `RX_VK_REFLEX`, `RX_VK_REFLEX_LOG=1`, `RX_VK_ANTILAG=0/1` | NVIDIA DLSS and Reflex, and AMD Anti-Lag 2, for one run (`=-` on Reflex or Anti-Lag 2: its extensions not even enabled): the readme's NVIDIA DLSS section. `RX_VK_DLSS_TRACE=<frames>` logs one frame's large draws every that many frames, `RX_VK_DLSS_DEBUG=motion` shows the motion vectors, `=alternate` the game's own upscale every other frame |
| `RX_VK_FSR4=0/1/2`, `RX_VK_FSR_DIR=<folder>` | AMD FSR 4 for one run (0 never, 1 FSR 4, 2 its Native AA), and another folder for AMD's DLLs (not from `hookshot_env.txt`): the readme's AMD FSR 4 section. `RX_VK_FSR4=1/2` and `RX_VK_DLSS=1/2` go over the Upscaler row, a saved FSR 3.1 too where the engine they ask for runs; `RX_VK_FSR=1` goes over them (one upscaler at a time). The DLSS trace and debug switches above apply to FSR 4 too, on the frame chain they share |
| `RX_VK_ASYNC=1` | The replay on a thread of its own instead of the game's submitting thread |
| `RX_VK_FIFO=1`, `RX_VK_IMMEDIATE=1` | V-Sync On (FIFO) or Off (immediate) for one run, over the menu's V-Sync row |
| `HOS_VCORES=0`, `HOS_CORES=<1..8>`, `HOS_RESERVE_CORE=0` | No virtual cores; the cores the game sees (6); no core kept for the replay (one is, with 8 or more logical processors) |

### Building

A build reads and writes tens of gigabytes. When the game folder or the build files folder is on a hard drive,
`make_game.py` warns that an SSD is much faster and builds anyway (the builders ask before they start).

| Switch | What it does |
|---|---|
| `HOOKSHOT_JOBS=<n>` (or `--jobs`) | Compilers at once (default one per CPU thread, each started when the free memory holds it; `HOOKSHOT_MEM_GATE=0` turns that check off) |
| `HOOKSHOT_LIFT_JOBS=<n>` | Processes that write the lifted C (default the cores, at most 16) |
| `HOOKSHOT_KEEP_BUILD_FILES=1` | Keeps the lifted C and the objects after a build, so that the next one compiles only what changed |
| `HOOKSHOT_MINGW=<dir>`, `HOOKSHOT_MSVC=1` | The llvm-mingw to build with; the Visual Studio route instead |
| `RX_CPM=<dir>`, `WGPU_NATIVE=<dir>` | The CPM cache (Vulkan and SPIR-V headers, VMA, FFmpeg) and wgpu-native |
| `RX_TARGET=windows` | On Linux: the Windows game, with llvm-mingw's Linux build in `HOOKSHOT_MINGW` |
| `RX_RELEASE=1` | A release build (`make_game.py` sets it): no console window, the shaders prepared before the title |
| `RX_PGO=gen` or `RX_PGO=<file>` | The hot code counting its branches for a profile, or built with one (`make_game.py` passes the shipped profile) |
| `RX_MARCH=<level>` | The CPU level to build for (default this PC's: `x86-64-v3`, else `x86-64-v2`, else `x86-64`) |
| `RX_VK_ONLY=1` | Only the Vulkan back end, with no lift |
| `OOT_WORK`, `OOT_DUMP`, `OOT_EXEFS`, `OOT_ROMFS` | The work folder and the dump's folders, over `work/dump.txt` |

## The pipeline state list

Every release ships a list of pipelines, merged from the sources in `assets/pipeline_states/`:

- `tour.bin.xz`, which only the pipeline tour (`scripts/pipeline_tour.py`) writes, replaced whole each time;
- `contrib/<name>.bin.xz`, one per contributed list, which people add.

Each has a note beside it (`<name>.md`) that says who recorded it, on what GPU, driver, build and settings, and the
route. [`assets/pipeline_states/README.md`](../assets/pipeline_states/README.md) has how to record and add a list. Each
record is a pipeline the game asked for: its shaders' hashes, the program variant's hash, and the target formats,
vertex formats and draw state it was made with (`nx2/pipeline_states.py` has the layout). It holds no game code: a
player's build turns the hashes back into shaders from their own `hookshot_shaders.bin`.

`nx2/make_game.py` merges the sources at every build into the game folder's `hookshot_pipeline_states_shipped.bin`. It
takes the tour's list first, then the contributed ones by name, and keeps each pipeline once. The same sources always
give the same bytes, and the first start's shader preparation builds those pipelines before the title. Without them a
new install builds them in play, and draws left out while they compile wash the first field load white for seconds
(v2.0.8 to v2.0.14 shipped none). The sources are xz-compressed, written with fixed settings, so that the repository's
history stays small. The current ones hold 11527 pipelines in about 175 KB.

Every release carries them:

- the AppImage with `assets/`: `scripts/linux/appimage.sh` stops without them, and `scripts/linux/check_player_build.sh`
  checks them with the image's Python;
- the Windows builder's `tools/assets/pipeline_states`: `scripts/release_parts.py package` stops when there are none or
  one does not read.

xz rather than zstd: the AppImage's Python is 3.12, whose standard library has `lzma` but not `compression.zstd`.

A game run writes `hookshot_pipeline_states.bin` beside the executable, adding each pipeline it makes in play. To add a
list, play on a build of the current source and add that file as a contributed list. `add` keeps only the pipelines no
other contributed list holds:

```sh
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py add <name> <game folder>/hookshot_pipeline_states.bin --who ... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py tour <tour lists>... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...   # the tour's, replaced
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py check                      # every source, and the merge, as CI and the release checks read them
python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py merge --out merged.bin     # the list make_game writes beside the game
```

A list depends on the settings it was recorded with: its records hold the target formats and draw state, so one recorded
at 1440p with DLSS shares few pipelines with one recorded at 360p.

Refresh the tour's list before each release, and after a change to the shaders' translation or to the state a pipeline
is made from. A record that no longer matches what play asks for builds a pipeline nothing uses, and the one play wants
compiles in play. When the record's format changes (its magic and record size, `MAGIC` and `SIZE` in
`nx2/pipeline_states.py`), the old lists no longer read and the release checks stop. Convert each source in place, or
record it again, and make a new tour list. The folder's layout stays the same.

## The options file

`hookshot_options.ini`, in the game folder, holds the Insert menu's rows as `<key>=<number>`: the row's name in lower
case with `_` for spaces (`frame_generation=2`, `invert_camera_x=1`), except Output resolution, which is `output_res`.
`gpu/vk/vk_menu.cpp` writes the whole file at every change (`save`), with `options_version=4`,
`microphone_device=<name>` when a microphone is chosen by name, and the controls (`pad_<button>` and `key_<button>`:
the README's [Controls](../readme.md#controls)). A value outside a row's range is clamped when it is read. Where the
number is not the obvious one:

| Key | Values |
|---|---|
| `quality_preset` | 0 Custom, 1 Minimum (4GB), 2 Low (6GB), 3 Balanced (8GB), 4 High (12GB), 5 Ultra (16GB+) |
| `gpu_device` | 0 Auto, n the n-th card with Vulkan 1.3 as the row lists them |
| `frame_generation` | 0 Off, 2 to 8 the multiplier |
| `resolution` | 0 Auto, 1 100%, 2 75%, 3 67%, 4 50% |
| `output_res` | A size, `<width>x<height>`: 2048x1152 (the game's own), 1920x1080, 2560x1440, 3840x2160, 5120x1440, 5120x2880, or any other with each side a multiple of 8 (rounded down), at least 640x360, at most 5120x2880's pixels, 5:4 to 32:9; anything else is the game's own. The numbers saved before (0 2048x1152, 1 2560x1440, 2 3840x2160, 3 1920x1080, 4 5120x1440, 5 5120x2880) are still read |
| `upscaling` | 0 Off, 1 Catmull-Rom, 2 Lanczos |
| `sharpness`, `rumble_strength`, `motion_sensitivity_x`, `motion_sensitivity_y` | percent |
| `mouse_sensitivity` | hundredths: 100 is 1.00 |
| `robust_buffers` | 0 Auto (on), 1 Off, 2 On |
| `game_speed` | 0 Per frame, 1 Real time |
| `text_speed` | 0 Normal, 1 2x, 2 4x, 3 Instant |
| `microphone` | 0 Off, 1 Default, 2 and up a microphone (the name in `microphone_device` decides which) |
| `mouse_camera` | 0 As the stick, 1 Native |
| `layout_preset` | 0 Nintendo, 1 Xbox / PC, 2 Swap Face, 3 Custom |

The other rows are 0 Off and 1 On. Some are read at the start, before the menu exists, by the code that needs them:
`handheld_profile` and `output_res` (`host/nn_applet.c`), `ultrawide` (`host/hos_main.c`), `robust_buffers`
(`gpu/vk/vk_main.cpp`) and the controls (`host/nn_hid.c`).
