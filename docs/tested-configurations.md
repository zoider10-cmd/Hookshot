# Tested configurations

What has actually been run, where, and how it went: one row per test run, newest first. The README's
[status table](../readme.md#project-status) sums this up by vendor; this page keeps the runs themselves, so a
regression can be traced to a build and a driver, and so the next tester knows what is already covered.

Add a row for your own runs (a PR, or paste it in an issue and a maintainer adds it). A run that worked is as useful as
one that did not. Keep it to facts you saw: the build (`hookshot vX.Y.Z-N-gHASH` from the first line of
`hookshot_log.txt`), the hardware and driver, the settings that matter, where in the game, and what you measured.
Frame rates come from `hookshot_log.txt` ("N presents, X fps") at a named spot, standing still unless the row says
otherwise.

## Runs

| Date | Build | OS / desktop | GPU / driver | CPU / RAM | Settings | Where | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-10 | v2.0.14 (source 3a9998c3), Hookshot Builder; later v2.0.14 + the scale-image SAMPLED fix (as in #1940) | Windows 11 Pro 26200, fullscreen | RTX 5090, 621.14 | Ryzen 7 5800X3D, 64 GB | 3840x2160 output, DLSS Quality (67%), Steam Controller (2026) | Castle Town market, Kokiri Forest | Plays well. On the release: HDR Expanded a black picture, Native flat (#1613); with the fix Expanded is right, frame generation 3x too. One crash in `nvoglv64.dll` (0xc0000005) after about 17,000 frames with frame generation 5x. Steam Controller started from Steam: no gyro until Steam's `SDL_GAMECONTROLLER_IGNORE_DEVICES` and `SDL_GAMECONTROLLER_ALLOW_STEAM_VIRTUAL_GAMEPAD` were cleared (#1897) |

## Limits of the original RTX 4070 Ti runs

- Real mouse aiming with Mouse camera = Native after #1462 (the camera states were traced, but not tested with a real mouse).
- Frame generation at 120 Hz or above (the displays here top out at 75 Hz).
- HDR output on an HDR monitor (the surface is offered, the picture was not judged on one).
