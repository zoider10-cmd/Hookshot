# Tested configurations

What has actually been run, where, and how it went: one row per test run, newest first. The README's
[status table](../readme.md#project-status) sums this up by vendor; this page keeps the runs themselves, so a
regression can be traced to a build and a driver, and so the next tester knows what is already covered.

Add a row for your own runs (a PR, or paste it in an issue and a maintainer adds it). A run that worked is as useful as
one that did not. Keep it to facts you saw: the build (`hookshot vX.Y.Z-N-gHASH` from the first line of
`hookshot_log.txt`), the hardware and driver, the settings that matter, where in the game, and what you measured.
Frame rates come from `hookshot_log.txt` ("N presents, X fps") at a named spot, standing still unless the row says
otherwise.

Same spot at 2560x1440 output: 56.3 fps. No device lost, saves written |
| 2026-11-10 | main b2bb214 + #1459 (Dear ImGui menu) | as above | as above | as above | as above, windowed | Title, Hyrule Castle road | F1 menu, help box, prompts, the game's font and the FPS badge all correct; 60 fps |
| 2026-11-10 | main b2bb214 | as above | as above | as above | HDR on | start-up | KDE offers an HDR10 surface (`vk: HDR: an HDR10 surface (format 58)`) |

| 2026-11-09 | main 7eac5bf | as above | as above | as above | fullscreen (`HOS_FULLSCREEN=1`) | Hyrule Castle road | fullscreen works, no device lost |

Slingshot and bow aiming: no fps change (51-52 fps, #1305). Pause / unpause: no freeze |

## Not covered yet on this hardware

- Real mouse aiming with Mouse camera = Native after #1462 (the camera states were traced, but not tested with a real mouse).
- Frame generation at 120 Hz or above (the displays here top out at 75 Hz).
- HDR output on an HDR monitor (the surface is offered, the picture was not judged on one).
