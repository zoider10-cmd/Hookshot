"""Linux builder updates, the same way Windows installs (builder/setup/setup.c, scripts/make_setup_parts.py).

A release publishes hookshot-linux.txt. Each part is a zip named by its SHA-256 and kept on the linux-parts release, so a
part whose files did not change is not downloaded again. The player's copy lives at
$XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot/builder/versions/<tag> (AppRun at its root, the same layout as the AppImage). An unchanged part
is copied from the builder that is running now (the mounted AppImage, or the version installed last time).
