"""a64-kit's guest model (rt/a64.h, rt/a64_rt.c) with a 64-bit guest window, written next to the lifted code.

a64-kit maps all guest memory below 4 GB (`A64_MEM + (uint32_t)addr`): its own loader picks every address. MKW
does not fit: a 39-bit address space, ~9.5 GiB of planned memory on the 12 GB layout, 2x 5.7 GiB sparse GPU
regions. With A64_ADDR64 (defined by the generated header) an access is `A64_MEM + addr` over a reservation of the
whole 39-bit space (Eden's fastmem arena, or our own), and lookups of code addresses refuse anything above 4 GB
instead of truncating it (code always lies below: Eden loads it at 0x80000000).

It also adds the interrupt flag and A64_POLL that nx2/poll.py's loop-header polls use.

The changes are text substitutions on the vendored files, each required to match exactly once, so a refreshed
a64-kit that moved these lines fails here loudly instead of silently keeping the 32-bit window.

/* (nx2/poll.py) loop back-edge interrupt polls: A64_POLLING builds clear c->poll and call a64_poll_cur, the backend's,
   when it is set. The call is handed nothing on purpose: the context parameter is noescape (A64_NOESC) and never
   captured, so a call with no pointer argument cannot touch *c, and the compiler keeps guest registers in host registers
   across the loop. (a64_poll(c), the old form, made every loop body reload and store them: a call that takes c may change
   any of it.) The poll sits before the backward goto, after the body's stores: at the loop header, a call C cannot mark
   as returning (LLVM's willreturn) left the stores after it not guaranteed to execute, and nothing was promoted.
   a64_poll_cur finds the thread's context itself (host/mkw_glue.c, hos_ctx). A64_POLL_CTX keeps the old form for the
   emulator-hosted DLL (nx2/rt/eden_shim.c), whose host's poll takes the context. */
