"""The pipeline state lists (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp: hookshot_pipeline_states.bin, written as the game is played): show them, keep the
repository's sources of the list a release ships, and merge those into it.

The repository keeps the list a release ships as separate sources in assets/pipeline_states/ (README.md there):

    tour.bin.xz                 written only by the pipeline tour (scripts/pipeline_tour.py), replaced whole each time
    contrib/<name>.bin.xz       one per contributed list, added to and never edited by anyone else
    <source>.md                 beside each: where it comes from (who, GPU and driver, build, settings, route)

nx2/make_game.py merges them (the tour's first, then the contributed ones by name; each pipeline once) into the game folder's
hookshot_pipeline_states_shipped.bin, whose pipelines the first start's shader preparation builds before the title. The same
sources always merge into the same bytes.

    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py <list>...                            what they hold
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py add <name> <list>... --who ... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...
        a contributed list, contrib/<name>.bin.xz: the lists' pipelines that no other contributed list holds (to an existing
        <name>, its pipelines are kept and the new ones added), and its note contrib/<name>.md
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py tour <list>... --gpu ... --build ... --settings ... --route ...
        tour.bin.xz and tour.md replaced by the lists' pipelines (the pipeline tour runs it)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py merge --out <file>                    the merged list (xz when <file> ends in .xz)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py check                                 each source whole, of this build's format, not empty,
                                                                          with its note; the merge the same twice (CI runs it)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py --out <file> <list>...               lists merged, each pipeline once (any lists)
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py --v2 --out <file> <list>...          the same, version 1 lists converted to version 2
    python -I nx2/pipeline_states.py --check <list>...                    each list whole and holding pipelines

add, tour, merge and check take --dir <sources folder> (default: the repository's assets/pipeline_states).

A list may be xz-compressed (read by its magic; written so when its name ends in .xz, with fixed settings, so the same records
always give the same bytes): the repository's are, so that its history stays small. xz, not zstd: the AppImage's Python (3.12)
has lzma but not compression.zstd.

A list holds no game code: each record is a pipeline's stage code keys (hashes of the game's shaders, which the player's own
hookshot_shaders.bin turns back into the shaders), the program variant's hash, and the formats and draw state baked into the pipeline.

Version 2 (HKSTATE2, written by builds since it) holds what the game asked for, the same on every GPU and with any settings: the
targets' NVN formats, whether the draw was a mesh draw, the draw's own topology, and the program variant's texture answers with its
stages numbered without the mesh fallback's generated vertex stage. Each GPU's shader preparation maps them through the rules its
draws follow (the formats it makes of the NVN ones, its mesh shaders or the mesh fallback). Version 1 (HKSTATE1, older builds) held
the recording GPU's choices: the Vulkan formats it rendered in, and on a GPU with the mesh fallback the fallback's topology and
stage numbering; the game still reads it.

    <list>: "HKSTATE2", u32 record size (552), then the records:
            u64 code[4] (vertex or mesh, fragment, task, the header-only stage), u64 variant (of the answers below),
            u32 mesh, topology (a mesh draw's: triangle list), targets, samples, has depth, depth NVN format,
            u32 colour NVN texture formats[8] (0: none), u32 colour NVN view formats[8] (the format each is drawn in),
            u64 blend[8], u32 vertex attributes[16], u32 attribute count, u32 strides[16], u32 divisors[16],
            u32 blend enables, channel mask, polygon mode, depth clamp, alpha to coverage,
            u32 answers, u32 questions, u32 answers[24] (stage, descriptor, image, type), u8 questions[32], u32 pad[2]
            (variant 0 with no answers and no questions: the variant nothing bound makes, each texture as its instruction
            declares it; lists converted from records without texture answers hold those)
    <list>: "HKSTATE1", u32 record size (528), then the records:
            u64 code[4], u64 variant,
            u32 mesh, topology, targets, samples, depth format, has depth, u32 color formats[8] (Vulkan), u8 color types[8],
            u64 blend[8], u32 vertex attributes[16], u32 attribute count, u32 strides[16], u32 divisors[16],
            u32 blend enables, channel mask, polygon mode, depth clamp, alpha to coverage, pad,
            u32 answers, u32 questions, u32 answers[24] (stage, descriptor, image, type), u8 questions[32] (each answer as asked)

Lists of both versions merge into version 2 (version 1 alone stays version 1; --v2 converts it too). A version 1 record is
converted: each Vulkan format back to an NVN format every GPU renders in it (V1_NVN: no format a GPU chooses itself), a mesh record
made with the mesh fallback numbered as the native one. A record that cannot be (a format the table lacks, a fallback record whose
answers were left out) is left out, and counted. When the record's format changes, every source is converted (or the tour's made
again): the layout of the folder stays.
