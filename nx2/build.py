"""Compile the lifted game (work/gen, from `lift.py --write`) into work/build/hookshot_game.dll (or a static library).

The flags are a64-kit's for lifted code (its build.py, cmd_native): -O1, LoopRotate's header copies capped (most of
the compile time in goto-dense giant functions otherwise), capture tracking past LLVM's 100 uses (the context
parameter is A64_NOESC), one section per function. The guest model is the 64-bit window (rtgen.py), shadowing the
vendored rt/, with the loop-header interrupt polls on (A64_POLLING, nx2/poll.py). Incremental: an object is rebuilt
only when its source or the flags changed.

hookshot_game.dll = the lifted chunks + a64-kit's tables and runtime + nx2/rt/eden_shim.c (the emulator ABI, mkw_host.h)
+ mkw_info.c (the image base and main's build id, generated here from work/image/image.json). Linking it is also the
check that the whole lifted game closes over itself: any unresolved symbol fails the link.

Heavy: 44 chunks of ~25 MB, ~100-200 s and ~2-3.5 GB each at -O1. The PC is shared with games: run it when the
machine is idle, and keep --jobs low otherwise.

--standalone builds work/sa/build/hookshot.exe instead: the standalone lift (work/sa/gen, `lift.py --standalone --write`)
+ the native runtime in host/ (TOTKPort's hos/, adapted). Objects are cached by their key in work/objcache, shared by
both builds: the two lifts share their chunk boundaries, so every chunk without a hooked function is the same source
and is not compiled twice.

Usage:  python -I nx2/build.py [--jobs 1] [--only 0,7] [--opt O1] [--no-polls] [--dll] [--lib] [--standalone]
  --only: just these code_NNN.c chunks (to measure); --dll: link hookshot_game.dll; --lib: archive hookshot_game.lib
  --dry-run: the start-up with no lift, up to the compile; fails if a file the compile reads (the lift's aside) is missing

  HOOKSHOT_TIMES=<build_times.json>: make_game.py's record of the earlier builds. With it, this run says which files it
  really rebuilds and how long each took before (@@plan, @@file, @@eta), which the builder windows show as a countdown.
