"""Changes to the lifted C for Ocarina of Time, applied by lift.py after it writes the code (and by hand: python -I nx2/oot_patches.py).

Each is a runtime switch where it can be, so the game's own path stays reachable.

- Dynamic resolution (Lichii's built-in "Max Resolution" patch, main+0x805BD0): the engine's config flag at +0x94 picks the path that
  follows the GPU-time controller; with hos_fixed_resolution set it takes the other path, the 3D at full scale. The controller made
  a new set of render targets at each size, ~11 images a frame at times, and held the GPU near its budget.
- Text speed (the Insert menu's "Text speed"): f_80b1e140 (main+0xafe140) steps a text pane's letter animation, the
  LetterAnimControl of the panes with "LetterAnimOn" user data (dialogue, Navi, signs). Its time argument (s0) moves the
  letters' clock (+0x60 += rate +0x4c * time, the rate from the message's speed tag) and the pauses' timer (+0x58 -= time);
  hos_text_scale multiplies it, 1.0 as shipped. The auto-advance timer (+0x5c, before) keeps the game's time. A huge
  scale shows a page at once (one frame per pause), as the game's own skip on A (+0x72 = 2, f_80794b00) without its flags.
- The fixed path's scale (hos_fixed_scale_bits: the Insert menu's Resolution) reaching the 3D, in the caller f_831f3200
  (main+0x31d3200). It recomputes the 3D's scale (+0xe5c = scale * +0xe58 / +0xe50) only while +0xe2c bit 3 is set. The dynamic
  path sets it on a level change; the fixed path's flag 1 calls f_831f41d0, whose bit 3 the apply block clears in the same frame,
  before any recompute. So the fixed path kept the dynamic path's last scale (0.75 docked: 1536x864 at every setting). Flag 1 now
  also asks for the recompute, and on the fixed path the flags +0xe20 bits 3/4 (a hardcoded 0.75 / 0.5 in place of the scale)
  are not looked at.
