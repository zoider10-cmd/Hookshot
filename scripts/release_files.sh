# A release's files, found and changed by the release's id: the Release workflow's releases are drafts until its
# publish job, and GitHub's get-a-release-by-tag (and so `gh release view <tag>`, which falls back to a second lookup
# for drafts) finds only a published one. A failed lookup must never read as "no release", so the release of a tag is
# found here by listing every release, drafts included (with GH_TOKEN's contents: write), and a listing that fails
# stops the script. A tag with more than one release (a draft beside a published one, say) is refused: which one is
# meant is for a person to say, by deleting the other.
#
# What a release gets once its files are on it: big download links for Windows and Linux above its notes, a "Which file
# do I download?" table under them, and SHA256SUMS, the SHA-256 of every other file on it in sha256sum's format
# (sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS checks a download). The sums are GitHub's own digests of the uploaded
# files; a file without one is downloaded and hashed. The Release workflow's publish job runs this for a release
# before publishing it, and scripts/release_upload.sh for a tag pushed by hand (and the nightly). Needs gh and jq, with
# GH_TOKEN (contents: write) and GH_REPO set.
#
#   scripts/release_files.sh find <tag>              "<id> <draft> <prerelease>" of the tag's release, drafts too;
#                                                    nothing when it has none. Fails when the listing fails or the tag
#                                                    has more than one release
#   scripts/release_files.sh upload <tag> <file> ... the files on the tag's release, by its id; a file of the same name
#                                                    already there is replaced
#   scripts/release_files.sh publish <tag>           the tag's release published, by its id: a version with a
#                                                    prerelease part (v2.1.0-rc.1) as a prerelease, never "latest";
#                                                    any other as the latest release
#   scripts/release_files.sh table <tag>             the table, in Markdown
#   scripts/release_files.sh links <tag>             the download links, in Markdown (from the files on the release)
#   scripts/release_files.sh finish <tag> [<out>]    the table under the notes (once), and SHA256SUMS uploaded (also
#                                                    written to <out>). Two runs at once (the Linux and Windows release
#                                                    jobs of a tag pushed by hand) leave the sums of every file: each
#                                                    one checks the uploaded SHA256SUMS against the files after
#                                                    uploading it.
#   scripts/release_files.sh check <tag> <name> ...  each named file and SHA256SUMS are on the release, and SHA256SUMS
#                                                    lists every other file on it, with its digest
