# rc, the latest release candidate: a rolling prerelease, never "latest" and not a version, that holds the Linux AppImage
# and its .zsync of the newest published release candidate or release (semver: v2.1.0-rc.2 < v2.1.0-rc.3 < v2.1.0, as
# the builder's Release candidate Update track has it, builder/linux/linux_update.py). A release candidate's AppImage
# carries gh-releases-zsync|<owner>|<repo>|rc|... (the Linux AppImage workflow), so AppImageUpdate moves it on to the
# next release candidate, and to its version's release once that ships. Its own tag would keep it where it is, and
# latest (the newest release) could be older than it; latest-pre would take the nightly, also a prerelease.
#
# The Release workflow runs this after its publish job (a release candidate's files, and a promoted version's), and
# when a release is published by hand, one run at a time (its rc job's concurrency group). Each run makes rc hold the
# newest release there is, found by listing the releases, not the one that started it: a run that was replaced while
# it waited, or that finished before a newer release, changes nothing the next run would not. The files are copied
# from that release (the same files, so its SHA256SUMS and their build provenance are theirs too), the new ones
# uploaded before the older AppImage and .zsync are removed, and the rc tag is moved to its commit. Its notes are short
# and point to that release. Needs gh and jq, with GH_TOKEN (contents: write) and GH_REPO set.
