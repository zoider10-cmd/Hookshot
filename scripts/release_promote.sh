# Promote: a release candidate (v2.1.0-rc.2) published as its version (v2.1.0), the release players get. The Release
# workflow runs this when it is started by hand (docs/versioning.md, "Promoting a release candidate"). Needs gh, with
# GH_TOKEN (contents: write) and GH_REPO set.
#
#   scripts/release_promote.sh prepare [<rc tag>]   the release candidate (the newest one when not given) checked, its
#                                                   version's tag made on the same commit, and that release made as a
#                                                   draft whose notes are those of the version's release candidates.
#                                                   Prints tag=, rc= and sha= lines for $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Run again
#                                                   after a failure, it goes on with the same tag and draft. Refused
#                                                   when the version is already published, when another Promote run
#                                                   is in progress, or when the tag has more than one release.
#   scripts/release_promote.sh record <tag> [<rc tag>]
#                                                   .release-please-manifest.json set to the version, when it still
#                                                   holds one of its release candidates, so the next release pull
#                                                   request proposes the next version's first release candidate (and
#                                                   .release-please-version); and the version's entry at the top of
#                                                   CHANGELOG.md. In the checkout it is run in; the caller
#                                                   commits it. Without the rc tag, the newest published release
#                                                   candidate of the version on the tag's commit. Run again, it
#                                                   changes nothing.
#
# The tag is made with GITHUB_TOKEN, so it starts no workflow: the Release workflow builds the files itself, as it does
# for a release candidate. They are built again from the same commit, not copied from the release candidate, because
# every file names the version it was built as (tools/version.txt, the AppImage's VERSION, the setup lists' tag) and
# the updaters compare that with the latest release's tag.
