# Game-free: a player's build started from what the AppImage carries, not from the repository. CI's AppImage job packages
# the builder but never builds a game with it, so a file the AppImage leaves out was found by every player instead: #1459
# made nx2/build.py write the menu's fonts from third_party/fonts at every build start, the AppImage does not carry that
# folder, and every Linux build stopped at LibertinusSans-Regular.ttf while CI stayed green (2026-11-10, #1567).
#
#   scripts/linux/check_player_build.sh [<Hookshot-...-x86_64.AppImage>]   (default: the newest in build-linux/)
#
# The image is extracted, as its runtime does, and run with AppRun's own environment (the AppImage's Python, compiler,
# sysroot, FFmpeg and the prebuilt Vulkan back end, HOOKSHOT_VK_PREBUILT) in an otherwise empty one, so nothing of the
# checkout or of CI's caches stands in for what the image lacks:
#   - AppRun --cli --help: nx2/make_game.py, as the builder window starts it;
#   - nx2/build.py --standalone --dry-run, as make_game.py runs it: its whole start-up up to the compile, which is where
#     the game's lifted code is first needed. Every other file the compile would read must be in the image.
# Neither may write into the image's tree: on a player's PC it is read-only.
