"""A stage library the driver has not compiled is not compiled in the draw, and is built once at most (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp
gpl_part, gpl_build_cold; no game/GPU).

The two functions are compiled as they are in vk_draw.cpp, beside a stand-in driver that has some libraries compiled, has
to compile others and cannot make one: the draw's thread must never compile, a cold library must be handed to a worker
once, and one that failed must not be asked for again. What the workers then build of the cold ones is counted, with its
time.
