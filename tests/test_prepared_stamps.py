"""The prepare keeps two stamps, and the driver's part is made from the program cache.

hookshot_prepared.bin said what the shaders were translated for (the translator and the seed), and the stage libraries were built
only as a program was translated. A program kept already was never translated again, so its libraries were never built again
either: a player who prepared without libraries and then switched them on had "0 new, 0 stage libraries", and after a driver
update, which empties the driver's cache, nothing made them again. The record now has a sixth word for the driver's part, and
that part (warm_libraries) walks the kept programs. This builds the record's reader, writer and check as they are in the source
and checks that a record of before the sixth word reads as warmed for nothing, that the word survives the record being written
again for a seed's new time, and that it does not survive another translator; and that the pieces are where they have to be: no
library built in the translation's loop, the walk on both of prepare_run's paths, the list of keys made without reading a
record, and RX_VK_GPL out of the translator's stamp.
