"""The Debug tab's Movement speed (1x to 3x): nx2/oot_patches.py's patch_cct_speed hooks the places a character controller's
forward speed is set (SPEED_PLACES: Link's move f_809552f0 at its two setter calls, the setter f_80559df0 and f_80964bf0), each
once, after its anchor, with s0's unit; a file patched before is given back as it is, and a file without them is left alone.
apply makes them only in the supported build's lift (protect_hearts). host/hos_main.c's hos_oot_cct_speed scales the speed for
Link's controller alone, only while the left stick is pushed and only up to 15 m/s (a ledge climb's 55 is left alone); the menu
sends the row's percent (menu_link_speed), 100 while the debug tools are off.
