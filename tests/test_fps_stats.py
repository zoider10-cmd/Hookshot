"""The FPS counter's levels (gpu/vk/fps_stats.h, vk_fps.cpp, vk_menu.cpp): Off, FPS, Frame time, Graph and Breakdown on one
row, an options file's old fps_counter=1 (On) read as FPS; the ring of frames, the averages, the 1% low, the graph's columns
and scale (tests/test_fps_stats.cpp); and that the renderer and the host feed them: a frame at each present, the renderer's
entries and waits timed only while the Breakdown shows, the host's sleeps of the presenting thread. No game or GPU.
