"""Frame generation 2x: a set's copies go to the GPU together, and only the presents wait for their times (#1702).

Each frame's copy into the window used to be submitted at its time, behind the game's next frame on the same queue, so the
game's own frames reached the screen ~3 ms after the made ones: 5.7 and 11 ms apart instead of 8.3, and a VRR display's
refresh changed every frame. Present ahead runs only for a paced set of two, only where the swapchain can hold two images
acquired at once (an acquire past its spare images has to time out), and RX_VK_PRESENT_AHEAD=0 turns it off.
