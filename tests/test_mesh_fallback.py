"""A GPU without mesh shaders (RDNA1, issue 640) runs task and mesh programs as compute shaders.

The console writes a mesh program's vertices and primitives to an internal stage buffer, and Vulkan's
VK_EXT_mesh_shader hands them to the rasterizer from there. A replay only needs the records: here the
task and mesh programs are ordinary compute shaders, their epilogues write the vertices to a record
buffer, and a generated vertex stage (drawing an ordinary graphics pipeline) reads one corner a
vertex from it. This checks that path end to end in the sources: the device enables it with buffer
device addresses, the translator builds the compute stages and the generated vertex stage, the
dispatches run before the pass, and the draw uses the GPU-written record count.
