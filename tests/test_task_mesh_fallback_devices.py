"""The GPUs whose task + mesh draws take the compute fallback by default (gpu/vk/vk_main.cpp, issue 996).

On AMD's Windows driver the native task + mesh path timed out the driver on Navi 22 (#1747) and on Navi 21: an RX 6800 XT lost
the device within minutes at Hyrule Castle's entrance, and played 25 minutes there with none through the fallback. This checks
that both chips are in the default, only for AMD and only on Windows, and that RX_VK_TASK_MESH_FALLBACK still decides over it.
