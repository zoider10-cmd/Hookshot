"""The memory trims keep what they must.

A recording's stream may move to a bigger buffer in the middle of a recording: what was kept as an offset into "the stream" (the
bank cache, the c1 uploads, the uniform overlay's mapping) has to name its buffer or reserve its room first. The BC3 scratch is made
when an upload needs it: every user asks for it first and stops when it cannot be made. A capture's buffer is sized by class, with
a floor, and the spare ones are counted out as well as in.
