"""The shaders are prepared again when the seed changes, not only when the translator does.

prepare_run (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp) prepared once per translator: hookshot_prepared.bin held program_cache_stamp() and nothing
else. The seed (hookshot_shaders.bin, nx2/shader_census.py) grows apart from the translator (4221050d added 19 compute
programs), and a folder prepared before such an update never prepared the new programs: each was translated in play when
first met. The record now also holds the seed's hash, size and write time; prepare_check hashes the seed only when its size
or time is not the recorded one. This builds the record's helpers as they are in the source and checks, on files in a
temporary folder: the same seed is not prepared again (and not hashed again); a changed seed is, and so is a changed
translator; a seed rewritten as it was (a new time) is hashed once and not prepared; a record from before (the stamp alone)
prepares once; a seed whose time is as new as the record's is hashed (its time cannot show a second write in the same tick:
whole seconds from libstdc++'s std::filesystem on Windows); and that prepare_run uses all of this. Every write time is set
by the test, so that it does not depend on how fast it runs or the file system's resolution.
