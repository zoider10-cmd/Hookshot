"""make_game copies the profile files and the window icon from a read-only install as writable files.

From a read-only tools folder (a Nix store, a packaged install) shutil.copy2 took the read-only mode along, and lift.py
then failed to write work/image/chunks.txt (PermissionError), on that build and every later one; the second build
of a game folder stopped on its read-only hookshot.png the same way.
