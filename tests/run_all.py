"""Every game-free check in one run: each tests/test_*.py and nx2/test_*.py in its own process, the C++ unit tests under
gpu/vk/tests and a byte-compile of every tracked Python file. All of them run even when one fails; the failures are
printed whole at the end, with a table of every check (slowest first), also to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when it is set.
Exits 1 when anything failed.

    python -I -B tests/run_all.py [--jobs N] [--timeout SECONDS] [--strict] [--no-skip] [--shard K/N] [name ...]

A name picks the checks whose path contains it. --strict: a check that needs a tool this PC lacks (a compiler, the
SPIR-V or Vulkan headers, spirv-val) fails instead of being skipped (CI installs them all). --no-skip runs the checks a
test skips on this OS too. Standard library only: no package is installed for the runner itself.

A test says what it needs in its own file, with up to three top-level assignments of plain literals (after its
docstring and imports). The runner reads them with ast and never imports the test; a test that declares none runs with
no arguments and its own defaults.

    RUN_ALL_ARGS = ["--cxx", "{cxx}", "--headers", "{vulkan_headers}"]   # its command-line arguments
    RUN_ALL_MODULES = ["zstandard"]                                       # Python packages it imports
    RUN_ALL_SKIP = {"windows": "needs spirv-val: checked on Linux"}       # OS ("linux", "windows") -> why it is skipped

{name} in an argument is a tool or folder find_tools looks for (cxx, vulkan_headers, spirv_headers, spirv_val, glslang,
dotnet); a check whose tool, compiler (the word after --cc or --cxx) or module is missing here is skipped, or fails
with --strict. A check skipped on both OSes (a GPU, the game) names both. A declaration that is not a plain literal of
that shape, names an unknown placeholder or OS, or any other RUN_ALL_ name, stops the run with the file and line; so
does one set or changed anywhere but its own top-level line (inside an if or a try, .append(...), +=, a subscript).
Only the tests a run picks (by name) are read: a bad declaration elsewhere does not stop it. A test that does not parse
fails, on every OS, without running.

The slowest checks start first, so a long one does not begin last and run on alone: tests/run_all_times.json has each
OS's checks of 2 s or more, as CI last measured them (a check not in it counts as 1 s). --shard K/N runs the K-th of N
parts, which split the checks by those times so the parts take about as long (CI runs Windows in parts); every check is
in exactly one part, whatever the times say, so stale times only make the parts uneven. After a full run on one OS,
--write-times puts that run's times in the file, for that OS.
