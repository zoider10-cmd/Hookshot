"""The translator is told the truth about a GPU whose graphics stages run wider than NVN's 32-lane warps.

AMD's GPUs pin only compute to 32 lanes (requiredSubgroupSizeStages 0x20 on an RX 5500M): a fragment stage runs at 64, so the
profile asks for the long path that keeps each 32-lane guest warp to its half (warp_size_potentially_larger_than_guest), and
the broadcast fallbacks walk all the host's lanes. On AMD's proprietary driver fragment-stage shuffles take the broadcast
fallback (Lichii #273: a basket in Link's house drew as a white blob), and a depth-compare texture is never an integer image
(#273: the shadow samples of the lighting). The profile's choices are in the program cache's stamp.

The long path is per stage: a graphics stage the GPU pins to 32 lanes as well (RDNA2/RDNA3 pin fragment, task and mesh:
requiredSubgroupSizeStages 0xf0) keeps main's short path, so only the stages that really run at 64 lanes change.
