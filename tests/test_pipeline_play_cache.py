"""The play caches of gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp, extracted unmodified, on a model of Vulkan pipeline caches and a driver's own disk cache.

In play every save wrote the whole pipeline cache again (0.5-1.2 GB) for what play had added: NVIDIA copies into the cache a
pipeline is made with each pipeline it takes from its own disk cache. Now what play makes goes into a cache of its own, one per
save, written alone to mkw_vk_pipelines_play_<n>.bin, and the next start merges those files.

Checked: in play the start's cache is left as it was read, one it holds comes from it, one the driver has goes into the generation,
one nothing has is compiled into the generation; a save writes the generation alone and goes on into a new one; a write that did not
land is tried again; a save waits for a pipeline being made in the generation it takes away; the next start merges the play files,
drops another driver's, ignores other names and numbers on from the highest; at 16 they are written into the one file, and kept
when that write fails; RX_VK_PLAY_CACHE=0 and a device without pipelineCreationCacheControl keep the one cache.

No Vulkan loader, GPU or game. python -I -B tests/test_pipeline_play_cache.py [--cxx clang++] [--source gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp]
