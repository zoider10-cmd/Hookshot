"""RX_VK_RECORDER=sync: every vkCmd* the renderer makes through vk_work.h is packed with deep copies of its arguments, and the packed
calls reach the driver exactly as the direct ones do. No game, no GPU, no Vulkan library.

python -I -B tests/test_recorder_sync.py --headers <Vulkan-Headers/include> [--cxx clang++] [--bench N]

1. The sources: vk_work.h has a macro for each call vk_recorder.h packs and no other, each macro calls its packer, every vkCmd* call
   in a file that includes vk_work.h is one of them, and the files that make vkCmd* calls without it are the known ones (their calls
   do not go through the recorder: a recorder thread would reorder them).
2. tests/recorder_sync_test.cpp, built with the real vk_work.h and vk_recorder.h and a fake Vulkan that logs every call with its
   arguments dereferenced: a frame of the renderer's calls, direct vs packed (sync) vs packed and run later (deferred) while the
   caller poisons its argument memory after each call, must log the same bytes; all packed calls covered; the fallback order kept.
   Run with RX_VK_RECORDER=sync and without, so the switch is read as the renderer reads it.
   RX_VK_RECORDER=defer (step 1.5), against the fake's command buffer lifecycle: two command buffers recorded into interleaved,
   reset/begun/ended/submitted/waited for twice, a query read and a destruction, the caller's memory poisoned; a recording handed
   between two threads under the replay lock; a 2 KB soft budget; a 1 MB hard budget; the second chunk's allocation failing; a
   parallel replay running (par_active). Each must log what the direct calls log, no command outside its command buffer's recording,
   no exception out of a vkCmd*, no block lost. Run with RX_VK_RECORDER=defer (mode 2, logged once) and with RX_VK_PARALLEL=4 too
   (refused: off, logged once).
   RX_VK_RECORDER=thread (step 2): the same frame and lifecycle with every vkCmd* run by a recorder thread, the fake driver slowed
   (1 us a call) so the recorder lags, each fake command buffer flagged in use for each call (two calls at once on one are a
   violation), the caller's memory poisoned and each packet poisoned once run; a handoff under the lock; a submit while another
   command buffer's commands are in flight; a pool reset while recording; the lock let go, then the recording ended on another
   thread; an 8 KB ring (backpressure); a packet bigger than its room (made directly, in order); no memory for the ring; teardown with
   work queued (stop, join, lazy restart, vkDestroyDevice); par_active; >= 1e6 packets through a 16 KB ring, twice, hashed against
   the direct stream. --throw: a driver call that throws on the recorder thread ends the process (exit code 3, FATAL). Run with
   RX_VK_RECORDER=thread (mode 3, logged once) and with RX_VK_PARALLEL=4 (refused).
3. The test has teeth: vk_recorder.h with a copy left shallow (all of them, or only the descriptor writes' image infos), with the
   fallback's drain left out, with no drain before vkEndCommandBuffer, with the replay lock let go without a drain, with a throwing
   allocation (exception safety broken), with the failure's drain left out, or with the parallel refusal left out, must fail it.
   Thread (each run with --only thread, so the recorder thread's checks alone catch it): no wait before vkEndCommandBuffer, before
   vkQueueSubmit2, at the replay lock's release, before vkResetCommandPool; no backpressure (the ring overwritten); no join at
   teardown; the recorder's exception swallowed (--throw).
4. (Windows) the process ends cleanly with the recorder parked in idle() holding its lock: tests/recorder_exit_test.cpp, a DLL with
   the real headers and an exe that calls ExitProcess (as the window's close does); exit code 0 within 20 s (a watchdog ends only
   that child) and the DLL's last global destructor run. Broken: the old global recorder with its destructor (wake, join).
--bench N: the packet cost per draw on the fake (fakes that do nothing), ns, median of 5; and the recorder thread's.
--overlap F: the replay thread's time a frame, off vs thread, with a fake driver that takes time and drains every K draws.
