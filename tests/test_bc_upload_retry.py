"""A BC3 texture whose upload failed is tried again, not drawn as it was left.

Decoded ASTC is re-encoded to BC3 on the GPU, which needs staging memory for the ASTC blocks and the BC3 scratch. With the
VRAM full (a 4 GB card after an alt-tab: the textures evicted and made again) those could not be had, the upload failed,
and the texture was marked uploaded anyway: its uninitialized blocks were drawn as coloured noise and never made again
unless the game rewrote its memory. Now it stays not uploaded and is tried again 30 frames on, and the log says why.
