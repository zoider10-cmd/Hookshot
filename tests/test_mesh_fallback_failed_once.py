"""A mesh fallback program whose compute pipeline the driver refused or faulted on is not compiled again (#1001).

fallback_compute_pipelines (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp) made the task and mesh stages' compute pipelines on a program's first
fallback draw and kept them; one that failed kept nothing, so every later draw of that program compiled it again. With a
driver that faults on it, each draw was one more fault caught by guarded_compute: 12,160 for one program in a Kokiri
Forest run on RADV, the frame down to 2-3 fps, and on a GTX 1070 the replay stopped presenting after the first one. A
failure is now remembered by the program's key and variant, and the program's draws are left out without a new try.
