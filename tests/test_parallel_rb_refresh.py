"""The readback refresh in a parallel replay's submission keeps what the GPU wrote earlier in it.

A parallel replay (RX_VK_PARALLEL) records one submission as several recordings: the part before a big command buffer,
its segments and the part after, with one write-back at the end. memory_rb_refresh copies readback pages (OoT's exposure
meter) from guest memory into the mirror; in a later recording of the submission that copy put the guest's page back
over what the recordings before it had written (the meter's sum lost, every frame too bright), including writes the
write-back does not see (a bare table entry's guessed range past its first 64 bytes). Serial replay's copies must stay
what they were.

Cuts the production code (memory_rb_refresh and its bookkeeping, gpu_buffer_bind's write-back note, the texture
recording hooks and vk_draw.cpp's storage-descriptor binding) into tests/parallel_rb_refresh_test.cpp and runs three
cases: parallel (the meter's sum), untracked (a bare entry's write past its head), serial (the copies, exactly).
