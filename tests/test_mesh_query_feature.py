"""The draw statistics capture asks for task and mesh shader counts only where the driver offers them.

stats_make_pool (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp) made its pipeline statistics pool with the task and mesh shader invocation counts
on every GPU with mesh shaders. Those counts are a feature of their own, meshShaderQueries, and a pool made with them
where it is off is not valid: RADV turned it off on RDNA2 after its queries hung now and then, and on a device of that
family with no compute queue of its own the first capture (RX_VK_DRAW_STATS) hung the GPU for good. dev.mesh_queries
(gpu/vk/vk_main.cpp) is
that feature as the device reports it, and the pool asks under it.
