"""The stage libraries are kept in Hookshot's own pipeline cache, and a warm pass only counts once that cache is on disk
(gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp build_graphics, warm_libraries; source checks, no game/GPU).

Asked for under the compile-required flag, the driver answers from a cache it is handed: a library the warm pass built into
nothing and let go was cold again at its first draw. So parts 1 and 2 are built into the cache, the cache exists before the
warm pass's workers start (the start that only warms had not made it), what is compiled counts towards a save, and the
warmed stamp is not written before the file holds the libraries.
