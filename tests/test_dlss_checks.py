"""NVIDIA DLSS's small checks (gpu/vk/dlss_checks.h): which scene sizes DLSS takes for an output (the handheld profile's
512x288 at Ultra Performance too, which a fixed 640x360 floor turned away), and Linux paths for NGX: which are ASCII (NGX's
Linux library takes only those; the others go to it as /proc/self/fd/<n>), and UTF-8 decoded (accents, CJK, bytes that are
not UTF-8). Built as C++ and run; also that vk_dlss.cpp and vk_draw.cpp use them. No game,
GPU or NVIDIA SDK required.
