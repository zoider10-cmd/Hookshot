"""The program cache's index (hookshot_programs.idx) and the precompile's parallel reads (gpu/vk/vk_shader.cpp).

The index names each record of hookshot_programs.bin (key, size, kind) in the file's order, so a start no longer reads every
record's head across the whole file. These checks read the source: the index is written after its record, never before; it is
taken only when its stamp, its sizes and the last record's head in the file agree with it, and what lies past it is read as
before; a record's head is checked against the index when it is loaded; the precompile reads its records on threads of their
own, each with its own handle on the file, and puts them in the program table under shader_mu.
