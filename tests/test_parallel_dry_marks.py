"""The parallel replay's dry pass (gpu/vk/vk_replay.cpp, RX_VK_PARALLEL) marks what the GPU will write before any worker
records: source checks, no game or GPU required.

A worker ahead of the stream uploads a texture it finds "never written"; that upload runs after the earlier segments' work.
So the dry pass has to mark, in stream order, every target a segment writes: a draw's (dry_mark_written), and a clear's,
which opens a pass on the worker just as a draw does. And a worker has to count the uniform updates exactly as the dry
pass appended them.
