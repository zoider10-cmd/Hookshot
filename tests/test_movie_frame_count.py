"""Above a 60 cap a movie's frame count grows by the frames' time, so a cutscene's cues stay with its movie (issue 1742).

The game's movie player counts its updates while a movie plays, and a cutscene that shows a movie places its narration, its
rumble and its end by that count. The movie's picture and sound follow the clock, so at 120 fps the cues came twice too early:
narration lines started over each other. nx2/oot_patches.py makes the count's step hos_movie_frames(player), and host/nn_vi.c
answers 1 while the host gives no frame time (a cap of 60: as shipped) and the frames' time in 60ths, the rest carried to the
player's next update, while it does (HOS_FPS_MOVIE=0: 1 then too, for comparisons). A game version whose code differs keeps
its own code and the build goes on with a warning.
