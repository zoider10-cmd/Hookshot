"""A wait on the recordings' timeline sends the held batch first (gpu/vk/vk_replay.cpp's wait_recorded).

With batched submits (RX_VK_BATCH, on with RADV) a recording's signal on rec_timeline goes to the GPU only when the batch
does. invalidate's readback wait called wait_recorded without a flush: the game job that read the value back waited for
a signal nothing would send, the main thread waited for that job, and its progress polls (the other flush) stopped. The
game hung loading a save. Reads the source: wait_recorded flushes before vkWaitSemaphores, and invalidate reaches it.
