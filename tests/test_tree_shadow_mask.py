"""OoT's tree-shadow mask is evened out over frames where the TAAU network is left out (#477, rebased as #1581).

The tree-shadow pass 3427a1dbefd5e02c offsets each pixel's shadow lookup by a normal it rebuilds from a gather of the
neighbouring depths; on grass blades and leaf edges those neighbours flip with the camera's sub-pixel shift, and the
pixels flip between lit and shadowed every frame (thin streaks over sunlit ground). The console's TAAU network averages
that away; a card that runs the stand-in instead saw it. Right after that draw its mask is blended with its own history
(shaders/shadow_stab.comp), RX_VK_MASK_BLEND=0 turning it off.

The pass and the two stand-ins push descriptors of their own layouts, so each marks bind_descriptors' cache of the last
push stale (descriptors_disturbed): without it, the next dispatch with the cached layout kept their bindings (a device
lost after a save load).
