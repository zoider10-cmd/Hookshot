"""A masked clear whose layout, shader module or pipeline the driver did not make is not kept, and is tried again (#1787).

clear_pipeline (gpu/vk/vk_draw.cpp) makes the full-screen-triangle pipeline of a masked clear on its first use. It ignored
what vkCreatePipelineLayout and vkCreateShaderModule returned, so a failed layout or module went on into the next calls,
and it stored whatever cached_graphics gave back: a pipeline the driver refused was cached as VK_NULL_HANDLE, and that clear
was left out for the rest of the run, even when the failure was transient. Now each step's result is checked, a failure
keeps nothing (the vertex module is freed when the fragment module fails), and the key is tried again on its next clears,
kClearTries times, then once every kClearRetryEvery of its clears: a driver that always refuses it costs no compile every
frame, and a device that was short of memory for a while still gets the clear back.
