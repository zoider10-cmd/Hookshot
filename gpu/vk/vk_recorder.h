// (hookshot) RX_VK_RECORDER: the command buffer calls as packets, step 1 of a recorder thread (the "sync" phase).
//
// Every vkCmd* call vk_work.h routes here is copied into a packet: its value arguments, and every array and struct it points to (the
// descriptor writes and the image/buffer/texel infos they point to, push constant bytes, vertex buffer arrays, the rendering info and
// its attachments, the barriers, the copy regions, the dynamic state arrays), so a packet owns all it needs and no longer reads the
// caller's memory. A packet is run by one decoder (execute: the packet's thunk calls the real ::vkx function with the copies).
//
//   RX_VK_RECORDER unset / anything else: off, the calls go straight to the driver as before (one relaxed load and a branch a call)
//   RX_VK_RECORDER=sync: each call packed, then run at once on the same thread, in the same order: the same calls with the same
//                        values, made from the packet's copies (the proof that the copies are complete and exact)
//   RX_VK_RECORDER=defer: (step 1.5, serial replay only) the packets held in the thread's arena and run at drain(), in order, on the
//                        same thread; the caller reuses its memory in between, as it will once a recorder thread runs them. Drained
//                        before every call of RX_REC_BOUNDARIES (vk_work.h: command buffer begin/end/reset, submits, presents, waits,
//                        query and fault reads, every destruction), when vk_replay.cpp's replay_mu is let go (DrainingMutex), before
//                        a fallback, at the soft byte budget, and when the arena has no memory (then the call is made directly).
//                        Refused (off, logged once) with RX_VK_PARALLEL>=2; while par_active, packets run at once.
//                        RX_VK_RECORDER_POISON=1: the arena filled with 0xCD after each drain. tests/test_recorder_sync.py
//   RX_VK_RECORDER=thread: (step 2, serial replay only) the thread that holds vk_replay.cpp's replay_mu is the producer: its packets
//                        go into one bounded ring (Recorder, below) and a recorder thread runs them, in order, while the replay goes
//                        on. Before every call of RX_REC_BOUNDARIES on the producer (but those of unordered()), and when it lets
//                        replay_mu go, it waits until
//                        the recorder has run everything it put in the ring: outside a replay_mu hold the recorder is idle, and no
//                        command buffer, pool or queue call of the replay's is made while its packets are in flight. Threads without
//                        replay_mu make their calls directly (after the recorder has run what was published, should it be busy:
//                        counted and logged once). The ring full: the producer waits (backpressure); a packet bigger than the room
//                        it is given, or no ring: the producer waits until the recorder is idle, then makes the call directly.
//                        Refused (off, logged once) with RX_VK_PARALLEL>=2. RX_VK_RECORDER_RING_MB (default 8),
//                        RX_VK_RECORDER_POISON=1 (each packet filled with 0xCD once run), RX_VK_RECORDER_STATS=0 (no 10 s stats
//                        line), RX_VK_RECORDER_SPIN_US (the recorder's spin with nothing to run, before it sleeps: default adaptive 20-200)
//
// A packet: [Packet header: thunk, next, op, size][the call's closure: its value arguments and the arena pointers of its copies],
// preceded in the arena by the copied arrays. The arena is the recording thread's own (thread_local: the parallel replay's workers each
// have theirs) and in sync mode is rewound after each packet runs, so it stays at one packet's size. A call whose structs carry a
// pNext chain (none does today) or a descriptor type the packer does not know is not packed: what is held is drained, then the call
// is made directly (counted in Arena::fallbacks).
//
// Include through vk_work.h, not by itself: the names below are the wrappers its macros call.
