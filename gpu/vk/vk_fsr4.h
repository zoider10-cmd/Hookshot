// AMD FSR 4, one of the temporal upscaler's engines (vk_temporal.h; vk_fsr4.cpp), through the AMD FSR API. Only the API's MIT
// headers are built in (third_party/fidelityfx), and only in a build with HOOKSHOT_FSR (make_game.py --fsr, which also puts
// the camera jitter into the game: nx2/oot_jitter.py). AMD's signed amd_fidelityfx_loader_vk.dll and
// amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_vk.dll are loaded from the user's PC at run time; none ship with Hookshot. Linux: a Vulkan FSR 4
// library (such as fsr4-vk's amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_vk.so) in their place.
