// (hookshot) AMD FSR 3.1 frame interpolation, and the optical flow it runs on, recorded as our own Vulkan compute passes:
// the made frame between two of the game's when the Frame generation row is 2x.
//
// The renderer already makes frames: vk_framegen.cpp interpolates between the last two presented frames from colour alone.
// This answers the same question with AMD's passes, which use the scene's depth and motion as well (vk_fsr3_inputs.h):
// seventeen compute passes -- seven of optical flow over two frames' luma, ten of interpolation over the game's motion and
// depth -- all of them our own dispatches over AMD's vendored GLSL, with no FidelityFX host library linked and nothing of
// AMD's loaded at run time.
//
// Where it cannot run -- not asked for, a device without the storage formats, image features or subgroup operations the
// passes need, a frame without its inputs, a reset -- the renderer's own interpolation runs exactly as before. Nothing here
// changes what the game submits.
//
// FSR 3.1's interpolation has no phase input (ffx_frameinterpolation.h fixes t at 0.5): it makes the midpoint and only the
// midpoint, so it is used for one made frame a frame (2x). At 3x and above the renderer's own makes the frames, as more
// copies of one midpoint would show the same picture twice and judder.
