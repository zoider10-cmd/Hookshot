/* The Vulkan back end (mkw_vk.dll) and the game executable: what each gives the other.

   The executable records the game's NVN command buffers (host/nvn_native.c) and calls a renderer through the rx_*
   functions (gpu/render/rx_nvn.h). With RX_BACKEND=vulkan host/rx_backend.c loads mkw_vk.dll, hands it the host
   functions below and routes the rx_* calls to the table it returns; otherwise they go to the WebGPU renderer in
   the executable. The DLL carries Eden's shader recompiler (gpu/vk/eden, SPIR-V back end) and sirit: their C++
   namespaces are the same as those of the WebGPU renderer's suyu copy, so the two live in different binaries. */
