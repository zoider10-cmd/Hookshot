// (hookshot) AMD FSR 3.1's camera, from the scene's own projection: plain functions, no Vulkan. tests/test_fsr3_math.cpp
// checks them.
//
// FSR 3.1's passes (the upscaler's and frame interpolation's) turn a depth into a view distance with four factors,
// device_to_view_depth (the SDK's setupDeviceDepthToViewSpaceDepthParams), and frame interpolation scales its disocclusion
// test by the tangent of half the field of view. The SDK builds them from a near plane, a far plane and a field of view; the
// projection the scene was drawn with has all three in it, so they are read from there instead (the camera's uniform buffer,
// gpu/vk/vk_fsr3_inputs.cpp: the same buffer NVIDIA DLSS reads its camera from), and no hook into the game is needed.
