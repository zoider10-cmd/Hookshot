// The Insert menu. Drawn with Dear ImGui over the window's image at the last step of a present (menu_record; vk_imgui.h, in the
// game's style: vk_ui.h), so it costs nothing while closed and it never touches the game's picture, nor what frame interpolation
// sees. The FPS counter and the start-up screen are drawn the same way. F1 always opens and closes it, Insert too by default.
// Up and Down choose, Left and Right change, Esc closes; the game gets no keyboard input while it is open.
// (hookshot) A gamepad's Home button, or Select and Start together, opens it too; the D-pad chooses and changes, the button
// the Switch's A is bound to changes too (and opens a page), the one B is bound to goes back (vk_menu_keys.h). The game gets no gamepad input while it is open either.
// Its Controls page binds the Switch's buttons to gamepad inputs and keys.
// (hookshot) The mouse is free while it is open (the window lets it go: WM_APP + 8, host/display.c and
// host/posix/display_sdl.c): the row under the cursor is selected, a click on a tab shows it, on a value's left or right
// half changes it down or up, on a toggle flips it, on a slider's track sets it (or drag it); the wheel scrolls the rows
// (never a value, wherever the cursor is); a right click is Esc. On the Cheats page and its lists a click is Enter (on a
// choice's or an amount's left or right half, Left or Right) and a right click goes back. The drawing records each control's
// place and the mouse is tested against that (vk_menu_hit.h).
// (hookshot) The rows that take a restart (Row::restart) are tagged "After restart" while their value is not the one the game
// started with, and the Graphics tab's help lists them. Closing the menu then asks whether to restart now (menu_restart.h):
// Later keeps the saved settings for the next start and is not asked again until they change; Restart now saves and
// closes the window as the player would, and the game starts again (WM_APP + 9: host/hos_relaunch.c).
