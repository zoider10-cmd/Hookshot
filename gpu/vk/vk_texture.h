// Textures (vk_texture.cpp): one VkImage per texture storage, with every level and layer, the way the GPU sees the
// game's memory. Draws sample views of it, passes render into views of one level and layer, copies and clears
// address it by level and layer. Replaces the first version's image per level and layer (vk_image.cpp), which could
// not sample arrays, cube maps, 3D textures or mip chains.
//
// After totk-pc-recomp's runtime/vk_texture.c (MIT): images keyed by storage address plus descriptor, uploads on first
// use and again when the CPU wrote the storage (page write generations, vk_memory.cpp), no re-upload once the GPU
// wrote the image (it is the content then), every image in GENERAL layout. ASTC, which desktop NVIDIA GPUs do not
// sample, is decoded on the GPU from its block-linear storage by Eden's decoder (host_shaders/astc_decoder.comp,
// with the Switch 2 GOB swizzle); other formats are unswizzled on the CPU straight into the staging memory.
