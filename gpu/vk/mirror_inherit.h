// Which part of a retired pool's mirror a new pool's mirror takes over (vk_memory.cpp, mirror_make).
//
// A pool remade larger gets a new mirror: guest memory whole, then the retired pools' mirrors over their part, for what
// the GPU wrote there and only there. A page the CPU wrote after the retired mirror's last sync holds the game's newer
// data in guest memory, and the old mirror's copy of it is stale. Copied over the new mirror, it counted as synced and
// was never fixed: OoT writes its light probes when an area comes in, so after a pool was remade the fog read the old
// area's probes for good (white glow, black or coloured blocks over the fog, dark shadows; a save reload did not clear
// it, a restart did). Only the pages not stamped since the retired mirror's last sync are taken from it.
